The Subscription card is issued credit card that manages all of your current subscriptions in one application. The card is linked to your bank account through the Marqeta API, so you can cancel any online subscriptions that are charging your bank account.

#### Prerequisites
Prerequisites that is needed is to download github as well as any text editor, we used Visual Studio Code and VIM 

#### Installing
1. Download Node.js for your operating system at [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Type into command line to install packages:
> yarn install 
3. Type into command line to run app in development mode:
> yarn start
4. Type into command line to launch test runner in interactive mode: 
> yarn test

##### Built With 
React stack- The web framework used

## Limitation
Currently, we are using the API to issue virtual test cards to display the subscriptions a user has. We are limited from testing it with real money and getting connecting with a bank.

## Technology used

The card is issued through the Marqeta API and we created a web application in React to cancel any subscriptions that a user that a user with our card has. Marqeta uses a card product as a template to generate cards which are owned by the user. We have developed a login screen that verifies the user with their card.
